# Coffee Shop Web Application

This is my first full-stack project. I use this project to learn more about HTTP, API's and technologies like React, Node.js etc. 

## Needed tech for this app:
### 1. MySql
### 2. Node.js
### 3. React

## To run this app:
### Have a MySql service running
### On the back-end run 'npm start' (or 'npm run devStart' if you want to run it in dev mode)
### On the front-end folder run 'npm start'
### This project will run in localhost. The dedicated front-end port is 3000, back-end listens on port 4001
